# opencensus-scala
This project is a lightweight scala wrapper for the 
[opencensus-java](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-java) library 
and provides instrumentation for scala based frameworks.

The API documentation can be found [here](https://census-ecosystem.github.io/opencensus-scala/api/).

## Implementation status

Opencensus-scala supports the tracing and stats apis of opencensus.

### Instrumentations
|Framework|Tracing    |Stats    |
|---------|-----------|---------|
|Akka HTTP|supported  |planned  |
|Http4s   |supported  |planned  |

## Quickstart
### Dependencies
Add the following dependencies to your sbt project.

```scala
// If you want to use only the core module
"com.github.sebruck" %% "opencensus-scala-core" % "0.5.0" 

// Dependent on the trace exporters you want to use add one or more of the following
"io.opencensus" % "opencensus-exporter-trace-stackdriver" % "0.13.2"
"io.opencensus" % "opencensus-exporter-trace-logging"     % "0.13.2"
"io.opencensus" % "opencensus-exporter-trace-instana"     % "0.13.2"
"io.opencensus" % "opencensus-exporter-trace-zipkin"      % "0.13.2"

// If you want to use opencensus-scala inside an Akka HTTP project 
"com.github.sebruck" %% "opencensus-scala-akka-http" % "0.5.0" 

// If you want to use opencensus-scala inside a http4s project 
"com.github.sebruck" %% "opencensus-scala-http4s" % "0.5.0" 
```

### Configuration
opencensus-scala uses [typesafe config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) to configure exporters,
sampling rates and many more. For a full reference have a look at 
[the default configuration](core/src/main/resources/reference.conf).

To activate the Stackdriver trace exporter with the default sampling rate of 1/10000 add the following 
to your application.conf.
```
opencensus-scalaÂ {
  trace {
    exporters {
      stackdriver {
        enabled = true 
        project-id = "MY-GC-Project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
